# sleepTestApp
A simple Xamarin android app for use in measuring sleep disturbances without waking the user any more than necessary. I made the app for my partner after she had trouble tracking when she was waking up in the night - either she would forget exactly how many times she woke up, or she had to spend some time opening an app to add a mark, which woke her up more. The app forces the screen to remain on (with a dark theme to minimize light pollution) and provides a large button to record the time for any sleep disturbance the user experiences. In the morning, the user can quickly email the results using the app.
